# PTVResearch
PTVResearch is a state-of-the-art particle tracking velocimetry software based on the Lucas-Kanade solutions to the Optical Flow equations. The software uses surface features to determine the velocities fields of solids and fluid flows, for a wide range of applications including: fluvial river flows, dense granular flows, and high fidelity fluid mechanics flows. PTVResearch does not only compute high resolution Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity data, but also incorporates advanced pre- and post- processing tools. The MatLab based graphical user interface installs directly as a toolbox, and can be used without any expertise.
