# PTVResearch
PTVResearch a GUI based code for particle tracking and particle image velocimetry based on the Lucas Kanade solutions to the optical flow equations. This code offers some of the most state of the art post processing techniques both Euclidean and Lagrangian. The post processing functions include image de-warping methods, the proper orthogonal decomposition and the PODDEM algorithm. This is a very early version of the code. Please follow the project for updates and for documentation. 
Please comment on any bugs you find and the will be fixed.
